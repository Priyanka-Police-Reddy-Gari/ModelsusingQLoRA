In this, we will use the following models:
Fine-tune the models using QLoRA.
(1) Choosing a model from google/gemma
(2) Choosing a model from meta/LLama
(3) Selecting a model from the MTEB benchmark (https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)

Dataset: As discussed in class, we will continue using the same dataset. 
Task Type: This remains a classification task, not a generation task. Focusing on building a classification model.
